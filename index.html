               <p>  On April 23, 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers named Torvalds as the 2014 recipient of the IEEE
                    Computer Society's Computer Pioneer Award. The Computer Pioneer Award was established in 1981 by the IEEE Computer Society
                    Board of Governors to recognize and honor the vision of those whose efforts resulted in the creation and continued vitality
                    of the computer industry. The award is presented to outstanding individuals whose main contribution to the concepts and development
                   of the computer field was made at least 15 years earlier.
